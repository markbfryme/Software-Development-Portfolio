    <li>Coding Basics of the Navbar Header
      <ul>
        <li>Added a title to the navbar, made the logo "float left" the command in the course was to add a pull-left class to the link element.</li>
        <li>pull-left was deprecated in bootstrap 4 with float-left replacing the class. Bootstrap 5 replaced float-left with float-start so that is what I'm using for my version of the page.</li>
      </ul>
