        <li>We'll learn how to fully utilize twitter bootstrap</li>
        <li>Visiting with the client...</li>
        <li>Most clients have no idea of what they want on their website</li>

    <li>Meeting with the Client
      <ul>
        <li>Get a sense of what the client wants in a website</li>
        <li>Talk to some customers to get a feel for what they want from the user experience</li>
        <li>You don't want to start coding right away</li>
        <li>You want to have some mockups to present the customer</li>
        <li>Uses balsalmiq for mockup</li>
        <li>Once the mockups are approved you will generally generate a design in photoshop (glimpse)</li>
        <li>Use fonts on website that can be found on google fonts</li>    
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Starting coding the website
      <ul>
        <li>Download bootstrap from the bootstrap getting started page</li>
        <li>Download jQuery, right click and save link as into your js folder</li>
        <li>Get the bootsrap starter page from Lecture 25</li>
        <li>Update the link for jQuery to the correct file/version</li>
        <li>Get fonts from fonts.google.com</li>
        <li>Select the fonts you want then copy the html and css code to implement in your index.html and styles.css files respectively</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Coding Basics of the Navbar Header
      <ul>
        <li>For browser-sync to work with files and files within folders use --files '**/*'</li>
        <li>We coded up the start of the navbar header</li>
        <li>You can learn how this should be implemented from the bootstrap documentation components&gt;navbar section</li>
        <li>We added a logo to the navbar</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Coding Basics of the Navbar Header
      <ul>
        <li>Added a title to the navbar, made the logo "float left" the command in the course was to add a pull-left class to the link element.</li>
        <li>pull-left was deprecated in bootstrap 4 with float-left replacing the class. Bootstrap 5 replaced float-left with float-start so that is what I'm using for my version of the page.</li>
        <li>I ran into more issues using bootstrap 5 so for the purposes of this course downloaded and began using bootstrap 3</li>
        <li>Once using bootstrap 3 my site matched what was displayed in the course videos</li>

    <li>Coding Button for Future Colapsible Menu
      <ul>
        <li>Start with adding a button to the navbar for the mobile version of the website</li>
        <li>We got the code from the bootstrap example website</li>
        <li>collapsed is a plugin</li>
        <li>Coding Nav Menu Buttons:</li>
        <li>Added menu buttons with glyphicons they automatically get picked up by the bootstrap collapsable menu with the classes set as they are</li>

    <li>More work on the example website
      <ul>
        <li>Coding the Nav Menu Buttons</li>
        <li>We used class selectors to give the collapsed menu button a maroon border</li>
        <li>We used class selectors to clear the float after the menu</li>
        <li>We used negative margin to shorten the height of the navbar space in preparation to make the font smaller for the mobile view</li>
        <li>Lecture 33, Part 1: Fixing the Navbar Layout, Text, and Dropdown</li>
        <li>We added media queries for lg, md, sm, xs</li>
        <li>In the medium, md, media query we addeds styling for a smaller restaurant logo so that restaurant logo/title div and the menu div would float and fit on the same page</li>
        <li>The collapsable menu bars were showing up as gray so I styled those with higher specificity to be maroon</li>
        <li>Lecture 33, Part 2: Fixing Navbar Layout, Text and Dropdown</li>
        <li>Within the xs media query we added styles to change the relative font sizes of the dropdown list items and glyphicons</li>
        <li>We used specificity to override the relative size for the glyphicon</li>
        <li>We added 5px right margin to give a little space between the icons and the text</li>
      </ul>

    <li>Lecture 34: Coding the Jumbotron
      <ul>
        <li>We first added the background image within an img tag in our html file inline for the extrasmall configuration</li>
        <li>We added the class img-responsive so that it is sized to the size of the extra small screen since this can't be done with css background image very well</li>
        <li>We next added the backgrond image as a background image in our styles.css file for the large screen configuration</li>
        <li>We repeated adding images for the medium and small screen sizes</li>
        <li>Adding them with @media queries ensures that only the screen size specific image is downloaded. The extra small image is always downloaded but this is inconsequential since it is small</li>
        <li>Next we'll fix the image sizing of the extra small image since it has incorrect borders etc</li>
        <li>We had an issue with left and right padding on the image</li>
        <li>This was due to specificity of two classes .container .jumbotron, so we just needed to add the .container class to our element selector</li>
        <li>Probably a good idea to add the additional class selector to each selector that contains .jumbotron</li>
        <li>We see that we are specifiying box shadow and border in all media queries so we can take this out to a more general specifier outside of the media queries</li>
        <li>Our jumbotron is now complete</li>
      </ul>

    <li>Lecture 35, Part 1: Coding the Navigation Tiles
      <ul>
        <li>We have several diffent configuraitons that we need to style</li>
        <li>The large and medium screens will have three tiles across</li>
        <li>The small screen will have two across with the map underneath spanning the full width</li>
        <li>The extra small screen will have all three tiles stacked</li>
        <li>This is essentially the layout we did in the module 2 project</li>
        <li>We created three tiles with proper column width classes to accomplish the above</li>
        <li>We gave each div an id for ease of selecting the elements</li>
        <li>We styled each tile with a width and a border and styled them to have a box shadow upon hover</li>
        <li>Part 2:</li>
        <li>Now we'll fill in the content, pictures, map etc.</li>
        <li>if you don't have images you are going to use you can go to <a href="https://placeholder.com/" target="_blank">placeholder.com</a></li>
        <li>We added images with center positioning so that when responsive size changes it just stays on the center and we don't have to worry about loading multiple size images</li>
        <li>Then we styled our tile titles to have absolute position bottom center with an .8 opacity background</li>
        <li>Next we populated the map</li>
        <li>maps.google.com searched for our location</li>
        <li>We copied the share link for our href</li>
        <li>We then clicked the embed tab and copied he iframe html, we modified the size to match our styles 250px height, 100% width</li>
        <li>Everything looks good except when we go to the extra small screen size, the borders extend outside of our tile images</li>
      </ul>

    <li>Coding the Footer
        <ul>
            <li>We're going to add a footer element after the main-content div</li>
            <li>Add a div with container class, div with row class content in spans or p</li>
            <li>Styled each section...</li>
            <li>Updated my site to not look like the real David Chu's Website</li>
            <li>Coding the Restaurant Menu Pages:</li>
            <li>When a user clicks on the menu button in the header or the menu tile they will be directed to the menu page</li>
            <li>we copy index.html to menu-categories.html and delete any unneeded content</li>
            <li>We made tiles for each menu category and applied classes for lg and md screens</li>
            <li>Part 2:</li>
            <li>We made the tile go to 3 across and 2 across for md and sm screens</li>
            <li>We made a custom class selector for xxs screens so that tiles stack once we hit 479px</li>
        </ul>

    <li>Coding the individual menu item pages
        <ul>
            <li>We look at our mockup and see we have a grid of individual items that span 6 columns each. Within each of those there are two items, and image that spans about 5 columns and a description that spans about 7 columns.</li>
            <li>Looking back at the menu categories page we notice there is nothing indicating that we are actively on the menu categories page. We add the class .active to our menu button, a bootstrap class, that will show the user that that selection is active. This makes the button highlighted showing the user that it is currently selected.</li>
            <li>We copied the menu-categories page as a single-category page.</li>
            <li>We mad a row class for the full grid and a row class div for the single item</li>
            <li>We use col-sm-5 and col-sm-7 so that for anything sm or above we will have that layout but we're ok with it stacking below sm</li>
            <li>We didn't make the image for the item responsive since it is a pretty small image already and shouldn't need to scale with device size.</li>
            <li>I had an extrea &lt;/div&gt; that was throwing everything off. Fixed.</li>
            <li>Part 2: Styling the html from part 1</li>
            <li>We added styling for the image and description</li>
            <li>We had to insert class selectors within the xs media query to have the image and description align in the center using margin auto for the image and text-align for the descrptions</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
