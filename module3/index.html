        <li>We'll learn how to fully utilize twitter bootstrap</li>
        <li>Visiting with the client...</li>
        <li>Most clients have no idea of what they want on their website</li>
        <li>Its your job to ask the right questions to lead them to the answer</li>
        <li>Bring other business websites to see what they like</li>
        <li>When everything is important, nothing is important</li>
        <li>Help the user identify what is really important</li>
        <li>Always find a way for the client to invest in your project</li>
        <li>Client needs to pick one person that is responsible for making decisions</li>
        <li>Limit the number of revisions the client can make (limit the number of free revisions)</li>
        <li>Google web client questionnaire</li>

    <li>Meeting with the Client
      <ul>
        <li>Get a sense of what the client wants in a website</li>
        <li>Talk to some customers to get a feel for what they want from the user experience</li>
        <li>You don't want to start coding right away</li>
        <li>You want to have some mockups to present the customer</li>
        <li>Uses balsalmiq for mockup</li>
        <li>Once the mockups are approved you will generally generate a design in photoshop (glimpse)</li>
        <li>Use fonts on website that can be found on google fonts</li>    
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Starting coding the website
      <ul>
        <li>Download bootstrap from the bootstrap getting started page</li>
        <li>Download jQuery, right click and save link as into your js folder</li>
        <li>Get the bootsrap starter page from Lecture 25</li>
        <li>Update the link for jQuery to the correct file/version</li>
        <li>Get fonts from fonts.google.com</li>
        <li>Select the fonts you want then copy the html and css code to implement in your index.html and styles.css files respectively</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Coding Basics of the Navbar Header
      <ul>
        <li>For browser-sync to work with files and files within folders use --files '**/*'</li>
        <li>We coded up the start of the navbar header</li>
        <li>You can learn how this should be implemented from the bootstrap documentation components&gt;navbar section</li>
        <li>We added a logo to the navbar</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Coding Basics of the Navbar Header
      <ul>
        <li>Added a title to the navbar, made the logo "float left" the command in the course was to add a pull-left class to the link element.</li>
        <li>pull-left was deprecated in bootstrap 4 with float-left replacing the class. Bootstrap 5 replaced float-left with float-start so that is what I'm using for my version of the page.</li>
        <li>I ran into more issues using bootstrap 5 so for the purposes of this course downloaded and began using bootstrap 3</li>
        <li>Once using bootstrap 3 my site matched what was displayed in the course videos</li>

    <li>Coding Button for Future Colapsible Menu
      <ul>
        <li>Start with adding a button to the navbar for the mobile version of the website</li>
        <li>We got the code from the bootstrap example website</li>
        <li>collapsed is a plugin</li>
        <li>Coding Nav Menu Buttons:</li>
        <li>Added menu buttons with glyphicons they automatically get picked up by the bootstrap collapsable menu with the classes set as they are</li>

    <li>More work on the example website
      <ul>
        <li>Coding the Nav Menu Buttons</li>
        <li>We used class selectors to give the collapsed menu button a maroon border</li>
        <li>We used class selectors to clear the float after the menu</li>
        <li>We used negative margin to shorten the height of the navbar space in preparation to make the font smaller for the mobile view</li>
        <li>Lecture 33, Part 1: Fixing the Navbar Layout, Text, and Dropdown</li>
        <li>We added media queries for lg, md, sm, xs</li>
        <li>In the medium, md, media query we addeds styling for a smaller restaurant logo so that restaurant logo/title div and the menu div would float and fit on the same page</li>
        <li>The collapsable menu bars were showing up as gray so I styled those with higher specificity to be maroon</li>
        <li>Lecture 33, Part 2: Fixing Navbar Layout, Text and Dropdown</li>
        <li>Within the xs media query we added styles to change the relative font sizes of the dropdown list items and glyphicons</li>
        <li>We used specificity to override the relative size for the glyphicon</li>
        <li>We added 5px right margin to give a little space between the icons and the text</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Lecture 34: Coding the Jumbotron
      <ul>
        <li>We first added the background image within an img tag in our html file inline for the extrasmall configuration</li>
        <li>We added the class img-responsive so that it is sized to the size of the extra small screen since this can't be done with css background image very well</li>
        <li>We next added the backgrond image as a background image in our styles.css file for the large screen configuration</li>
        <li>We repeated adding images for the medium and small screen sizes</li>
        <li>Adding them with @media queries ensures that only the screen size specific image is downloaded. The extra small image is always downloaded but this is inconsequential since it is small</li>
        <li>Next we'll fix the image sizing of the extra small image since it has incorrect borders etc</li>
        <li>We had an issue with left and right padding on the image</li>
        <li>This was due to specificity of two classes .container .jumbotron, so we just needed to add the .container class to our element selector</li>
        <li>Probably a good idea to add the additional class selector to each selector that contains .jumbotron</li>
        <li>We see that we are specifiying box shadow and border in all media queries so we can take this out to a more general specifier outside of the media queries</li>
        <li>Our jumbotron is now complete</li>
      </ul>

    <li>Lecture 35, Part 1: Coding the Navigation Tiles
      <ul>
        <li>We have several diffent configuraitons that we need to style</li>
        <li>The large and medium screens will have three tiles across</li>
        <li>The small screen will have two across with the map underneath spanning the full width</li>
        <li>The extra small screen will have all three tiles stacked</li>
        <li>This is essentially the layout we did in the module 2 project</li>
        <li>We created three tiles with proper column width classes to accomplish the above</li>
        <li>We gave each div an id for ease of selecting the elements</li>
        <li>We styled each tile with a width and a border and styled them to have a box shadow upon hover</li>
        <li>Part 2:</li>
        <li>Now we'll fill in the content, pictures, map etc.</li>
        <li>if you don't have images you are going to use you can go to <a href="https://placeholder.com/" target="_blank">placeholder.com</a></li>
        <li>We added images with center positioning so that when responsive size changes it just stays on the center and we don't have to worry about loading multiple size images</li>
        <li>Then we styled our tile titles to have absolute position bottom center with an .8 opacity background</li>
        <li>Next we populated the map</li>
        <li>maps.google.com searched for our location</li>
        <li>We copied the share link for our href</li>
        <li>We then clicked the embed tab and copied he iframe html, we modified the size to match our styles 250px height, 100% width</li>
        <li>Everything looks good except when we go to the extra small screen size, the borders extend outside of our tile images</li>
      </ul>

    <li>Coding the Footer
        <ul>
            <li>We're going to add a footer element after the main-content div</li>
            <li>Add a div with container class, div with row class content in spans or p</li>
            <li>Styled each section...</li>
            <li>Updated my site to not look like the real David Chu's Website</li>
            <li>Coding the Restaurant Menu Pages:</li>
            <li>When a user clicks on the menu button in the header or the menu tile they will be directed to the menu page</li>
            <li>we copy index.html to menu-categories.html and delete any unneeded content</li>
            <li>We made tiles for each menu category and applied classes for lg and md screens</li>
            <li>Part 2:</li>
            <li>We made the tile go to 3 across and 2 across for md and sm screens</li>
            <li>We made a custom class selector for xxs screens so that tiles stack once we hit 479px</li>
        </ul>
